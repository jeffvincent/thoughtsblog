title: Andrew Jackson, American Badass
description: Andrew Jackson was not only one of the most badass Presidents in
  our history, but maybe one of the most badass humans to ever walk among us.

This might be one of the more *non-sequitory* of our non-sequitors. I don't
have a history degree (history was one of the subjects I didn't like in school) 
but I've developed a serious addiction to Presidential biographies. My favorites
so far are JFK and Andrew Jackson. While JFK's Presidential tenure is the more
interesting of the two (missile crises, celebrities, and Russians, etc.) Jackson's
pre-Presidential life is just insane. I've got three stories that I will
convince you Andrew Jackson was one of the **most badass humans to ever walk
this planet**.

Andrew Jackson, our seventh president, was born March 15th, 1767, in an area so
remote for the times that it's unknown whether it is present-day North or South
Carolina. His father died shortly before he was born, and his mother was
pressed into the labor force. Because of this, his childhood wasn't much for
nurturing. This might have influenced his later demeanor and outlook (I'll let
you be the judge).

## A Badass Earns His Scars

The American Revolutionary War broke out when Jackson was eight, and though he
was too young to fight (he probably wanted to) a few years in he would serve as
a courier (I think back then having jobs while going to school was more of a
requirement than something you did to pay for gas money and movie tickets). Two
of his brothers died during the War, and he was held as a prisoner of the
British.

During this captivity, one particularly dumb soldier, British Major Coffin,
demanded Jackson clean his boots (trying to show his superiority over a
thirteen year old kid). Jackson refused, and Major Coffin tried to cut him up
with his sword. Jackson reaches up and grabs the sword blade, no problem. He
suffered permanent scars on his hands and face, but pretty much marked himself
a badass for all time.

## "I'll surrender to you Jackson, but you alone."

Andrew Jackson becomes an orphan shortly after he is freed from imprisonment,
another major event that (obviously) changes his life forever. He goes on to
earn a law degree at the ripe old age of 22 years old. While he vacillated
between legal and governmental roles over the following years, he was in his
thirties and a judge in Jonesborough, Tennessee when Russell Bean's case crossed
his desk.

Russell Bean is described as a brute and a drunk who cut the ears off his
infant child. When the case landed before Jackson, Bean refused to appear.
Jackson, who because of his experiences put family before all else, demanded
the sheriff go an wrangle the fugitive Bean. The sheriff, being
intelligent but perhaps not terribly brave, requested Jackson join his posse in going
to arrest Bean. Jackson, being a total badass, accepted.

As the posse neared Bean's home, they found him barricaded inside with guns
pointing through the windows. He threatened to shoot anyone who approached, so
the law men were ready for a stand-off. Jackson, having no patience for this
kind of thing, marches right up onto the porch and demands his surrender. Bean
gives in without firing a single shot. His reply, according to legend, was,
"I'll surrender to you Jackson, but you alone."

When asked why he gave in without a fight to Jackson, Bean said he looked in
Jackson's eyes and saw he wouldn't hesitate to kill a man. Those are some scary
eyes!

## Duel with Charles Dickinson

This Jackson story needed to be included because it not only highlights
how badass he was, but it also had some pretty serious American history
ramifications.

To my knowledge, it's not completely clear why Charles Henry Dickinson and Jackson
came to blows. It seems to have something to do with Dickinson challenging Jackson's
honor. While Jackson was pretty darn smart, he also handled quite a few confrontations
with violence.

Jackson challenged Dickinson to a duel, which back then was pretty much
something you couldn't really pass on. This is where things get really
interesting. According to legend, Jackson allows Dickinson to shoot first, and
he does, burying a bullet in Jackson's chest. Jackson climbs to his feet and
shoots Dickinson in the head, killing him. While I don't condone violence in
any way, it's hard for me to not think of him as more badass after hearing that
story.

Because he goes on to become President twenty years later, this duel is a pretty
influential moment in U.S. History. The bullet Dickinson put in Jackson, a few
inches from his heart, would remain lodged there for the rest of his life and
cause a whole host of health issues.

On the other side, had Dickinson won the duel (and killed Jackson), would some
of the major outcomes from Jackson's presidency have happened? The Trail of
Tears, the Battle of New Orleans, and even the Civil War were influenced by
Jackson's decisions.

want an excellent Andrew Jackson book (where I first read these stories),
I would recommend [American Lion](http://www.amazon.com/American-Lion-Andrew-Jackson-White/dp/0812973461)
