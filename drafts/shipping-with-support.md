title: Shipping with Support
description: 
  We are shipping constantly, which is a good thing. But we weren't
  always providing excellent support around those launches (not so good).
  Here's the story of how we changed.

People are always saying "ship it." Shipping has become synonymous with
success, replacing the old "crushing it" as the go-to verbage for "doing
stuff."

I'm pretty sure this is great advice - releasing new things into the wild is 
the only way they actually create value. If your customers don't know about a 
feature, does it even exist?

But *shipping* also means change. A change in layout, a change in flow, a
change in daily habits. Customers aren't known to exactly *love* change,
which is a constant drag force on the speed of releasing updates. Everyone
knows someone (ahem, Ben) who is still using Snow Leopard (AKA Mac OS X 10.6).

This fear of change often manifests itself in a near panic on release day. That
panic can turn to anger if not resolved quickly, which is a *big* problem for a
tiny support team like ours. Release days are supposed to be fun, not the huge
source of stress we experienced for years.

Release days used to mean hours hunched over the screen, typing out empathetic
emails and calmly explaining the workflow updates through gritted teeth.

A short time ago, we released easily the largest update to our product to-date.
Codenamed *Customize*, it made sweeping changes to our video experience
customization paradigm, and it was a very real concern that many of our
existing customers would be confused about the new workflow changes.

While the transition has not gone perfectly, compared to the size of the
change, I'd say we did really well. Let's dive into how we added better support
to our shipping process, and how that has saved us (and our customers)
countless hours.

## Months Before Launch

Customize, as I mentioned, was a big change. We talked about it for almost six
months before any actual "work" was done. Brendan, Max, and Ben did serious
deep thinking on the future implications of this change - once it was made it
would be very difficult to undo.

Joe took those discussions and made them a sketched reality, diagramming out
the updated workflow once we switched to this setup. Having the entire team
involved in these discussions was hugely important; we could begin forming a
mental model of using the customization and embedding workflows (which to that
point had been one, slightly confusing flow).

## Weeks Before Launch

Once the new approach had been critiqued and picked apart, Max began the
actual coding work. He sank into his desk chair and worked for nearly two
months straight, with only occasional pauses to brew tea and beat us all at
ping-pong.

During this time, I think it's pretty important that support stays the heck out
of the way. Max is charged with inventing the future, and to a certain extent,
the support crew is charged with protecting and polishing what we have today.

Once there was a living, breathing prototype to mess with, we convened a small 
crew, representing Engineering, Design, Product, and Support (there were maybe
six of us). This group would be tasked with polishing and performing what I'll
call *scenario analysis* (no clue if that is a thing).

Scenario analysis, in this case, meant getting into the mind of our two core
groups: 

* Existing customers, who are familiar with the product and want to remain
  comfortable using it.
* First time users, who have never used the product before.

Our questions centered around the flow from one step to the next - after taking
x step, would they know what to do next? It needed to be as obvious as
possible, so we weren't creating new bottlenecks in our accomplishment funnel.

While those meetings were mentally grueling, I'd say that experience saved us
~30% of support inquiries. We noted things like unclear language, needed
calls-to-action, and the crowding of basic features by more advanced ones. All
of these things create confusion points for our customers, and support feels
the weight of that confusion.

## Exactly 10 Days Before Launch

We knew we needed to get ahead of this change, or else it would swallow us
whole. It would need to be carefully and clearly presented, if we were going to
weather the storm safely. We decided to do a pre-launch campaign, something
we'd never done before.

We drafted up a "Customize is Coming" [blog post](http://wistia.com/blog/coming-soon-customize), 
which laid out our reasoning for undertaking this change. I was deliberate in
including language that communicated how much thought and consideration went
into any change that messed with our customer's established workflows.

This post was linked inside the app using a notification bar we lovingly call
"the psychobar" (pictured). A link to the post was [also emailed out](http://pages.wistia.com/webmail/9972/221153775/f2d11d08327fd86ed58f6cf179ad9bb7)
to our customers.

We also included in the post a signup link for a webinar our Customer Champions
Max Kohl and Jordan would be conducting on the day of launch. When this post went
live, we actually didn't know the exact launch date (Max was still in the weeds
figuring out some technical/UI problems). We generated more than a hundred
webinar sign-ups, which is a pretty solid number for us.

## Days Before Launch

Once Max gave us the thumbs up that the feature was ready, we set an exact date
for launch and it was time to start creating content.

We already had the rough of a marketing video shot and edited, and Chris
dropped in some updated product shots (to make sure we were showing off the
final look!). We then shot a separate **mechanics** version of the launch video.

### What's a Mechanics Video?

One problem we had run into consistently with launches was trying to create
content that spoke to *why* this new fangled thing was useful, and also *how*
customers could go about using it. This combination led to some seriously
muddled messages. To fix it, we made the focus for each video clearer: the
marketing video was designed for the *why*, and the mechanics video took care
of the *how*.

The other major piece of content needed before launch day was updated
documentation. We knew from prior launches that our experienced users would
look there first. Making sure the updated doc also reinforced the new paradigm
would be important for first time users as well.

## Launch Day

On launch morning (or some approximation of morning) our [launch blog post](http://wistia.com/blog/introducing-customize)
went live and Max flipped the switch to update accounts. Max Kohl and Jordan
followed up with folks that wanted to learn more in the webinar, and they
scheduled it for the next day.

The blog post and support inbox was really important for capturing that first
wave of feedback. To make sure we presented a unified front, the entire team
gathered around our *megadesk* (which also doubles as our dining table). We
braced ourselves, ready for the bruising post-launch support onslaught. While 
some folks were understandably frustrated, and many had questions, altogether
we came through the experience with even happier customers.

Max and Jordan gave an hour long webinar to a "packed room", full of our loyal
customers who wanted to make sure they were on top of the new features this
launch presented.
