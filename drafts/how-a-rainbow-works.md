title: How a Rainbow Works
---

Rainbows are one of the most beautiful and transfixing phenomena in nature.

Because of their rarity, rainbows have always been associated with magical
events, like leprechauns with their hidden pot of gold. Seeing one has always
been considered connected with good luck.

Well, that's total crap.

Rainbows are sunlight being refracted through a medium before it strikes your
eyes. That's it. Sorry, [there's no gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8)
, and a little later on you'll even see why it's not *possible* to find the
end of a rainbow. You aren't more lucky for having seen a rainbow (although you 
are totally entitled to feel more awesome).

Destruction of blissful ignorance aside, we gotta give nature some credit!
There is a very intricate collaboration that has to happen between the Sun, the
rain, and your eye in order for a rainbow to appear. It's nature, and it's
pretty neat. Let's get into how it all works.

## What is happening to create a rainbow?

[Dark Side of the Moon cover]

If you grew up in the 70's, or are awesome, you no doubt recognize Pink Floyd's
Dark Side of the Moon cover. Every rock nerd I know (and love) owns the
t-shirt.  It's also an awesome recreation of an experiment that Sir Isaac
Newton ran in 1672.

Newton passed light through a prism, and using [refraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracted)
(essentially the *bending* of the light) split the single beam of light into
it's color components. Because the colors are at slightly different
wavelengths, they refract at slightly different angles when entering a new
medium (which for Newton was a prism, and for a rainbow is water). These
slightly different angles are also what creates the vision of bands in the
rainbow.

So now let's apply this situation to the water droplet. Light from the Sun
enters the droplet, refracts, reflects off the back wall, and refracts again
when exiting the water droplet and hurtling towards your eyes. The light is now
a single color, instead of the white light it started with.

Red light, because of it's longer wavelength, refracts at 42 degrees, while
blue light refracts at 40 degrees. Between those two measurements is where the
*entirety* of the rainbow lives. Cool!

## What are the conditions for seeing a rainbow?

[image of conditions necessary for a rainbow]

First condition: There has to be lots of Sun, and rain. Ok, you're saying, that's
obvious. But think about it - the Sun cannot be blocked by clouds, but there
are water droplets in the air. It's a pretty a rare combination in weather
(although something you can easily recreate in your backyard using a hose).

Second condition: You must be positioned between the Sun and the rain. The Sun must be
"behind" you in the sky (in other words, your shadow goes out in front of you),
and the water droplets must be in front of you (in other words, your shadow is
closer to the rain than you are). This is important because the light
must *reflect* off the back wall of a rain drop, and head back to your eye.

Third Condition: You cannot be wearing sunglasses - at least the polarized
kind. All rainbow light is polarized light, so you won't be able to see it if
you're sporting those slick Gucci shades.

## How do I see a rainbow?

To track a rainbow, you must first find your *antisolar point*. Imagine a line
being drawn from the center of the Sun, down through your head, and to the head
of your shadow. This line is actually the *center* of your rainbow. But more on
that later. For now just remember "anti" "solar", as in "opposite of sun".

If the three conditions we talked about are met, the instructions [Professor
Walter Lewin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lewin) gave in his wonderful
book, [For the Love of Physics](http://www.amazon.com/For-Love-Physics-Rainbow-Journey-ebook/dp/B003UV8TFE),
are the best I've heard:

> First, turn your back to the sun. Then locate the shadow of your head, and
> look about 42 degrees in any direction away from the imaginary line [ed:
> which is what Prof. Lewin calls the *antisolar point*, because he is awesome].
> If there's enough sunlight, and if there are enough raindrops, the
> collaboration will work and you'll see a colorful bow.

So at this point, I've covered the basic science behind a rainbow (i.e. a
rainbow is refracted light hitting your eyes). But for all you curious folks,
learning something new tends to create more questions than answers. Here are
some of the coolest questions I could think of regarding rainbows.

## Why is a rainbow...bowed?

If you used one of those protractors from middle school, selected a single
point (your *antisolar point*) and then sketched a constant point 42 degrees
from the point, you'd get a circle. A rainbow is actually a full circle - it
only looks like an arch because the darn ground gets in the way!  Next time
you're on a plane, look down at some rainy clouds and you might just see a
perfectly circular rainbow!

## Man, what's with all this talk about angles? Geometry is the worst!

Try this. Roll up a piece of paper like a cone, and leave a tiny hole in the
smaller end.

Facing away from a large light source, aim your "looking glass" directly at the
head of your shadow. From your line of sight, the edges of the looking glass
look like a circle, right? In the event all the conditions for seeing a rainbow
were met and your telescope was wide enough (i.e. almost 90 degrees total), the
rainbow would exactly match the edge of your improvised looking glass.

## Where's the end of the rainbow?

A rainbow is not a stationary thing - if you move, so does your shadow, and
therefore so does your *antisolar* line. Not only is it not possible to *reach*
the end of the rainbow, it's not even possible to see a rainbow at an angle!

This is actually my *favorite* part about rainbows. The light beams you see are
the ones that perfectly hit your eye. The light beams that hit your eye are
different than those that hit someone else's, even if they are standing right
next to you. **Everyone sees their own individual rainbow**. Whoa, mind
blown.

## Why is the order of the colors always the same?

[image of water droplets stacked on top of each other, with bands of colored
light heading down to your eye]

The order of the colors of a rainbow is *always* the same because the angle the
light refracts at is *always* the same. From top to bottom, it's always
**red**, then **green**, then **blue** (or, because Newton moonlighted as a
Benjamin Moore salesperson, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and
violet). This is true *unless* you are looking at a secondary rainbow, aka a
*double rainbow*, which we'll cover in a minute.

Let's go through an example.

Imagine three water droplets, stacked on top of each other. Each water droplet
refracts the suns light, breaking it into the color spectrum. Then it reflects
back towards your eyes. But because our eyes are this teeny tiny lens, only
light moving at a specific angle will make it back to your eye. So each droplet
contributes a small part of the total spectrum you see as a rainbow - the top
droplet contributes the red light, the middle droplet the green light, and the
bottom droplet contributes the blue light.

## What's a double rainbow?

The double rainbow, made most famous by a young man named [Bear Vasquez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8),
is really *always there*, it can just be hard to see. Some of the light
inside the water droplet reflects not just once, but twice. This fainter second
rainbow then appears outside the first (at an angle ~50 degrees), and, because
of the second reflection, the *colors are flipped*! That's right - in a double
rainbow, the blue light is on top, and the red at the bottom.

Now *That's* beauty all the way across the sky.

## When is the best time to see a rainbow?

The lower the Sun is in the sky, the higher the arc of the rainbow. This is
because of the angle the light is refracted at (crazy how this whole rainbow
thing is driven by that single principle).

The early morning and the late afternoon, then, are the best times for
rainbows. So if there's a sunshower just before dinner, run outside, there is
probably an awesome rainbow to see.

## What's the best way to capture an awesome rainbow?

If you've recently upgraded your camera arsenal, and want to shoot your next
video with a rainbow in the background, you'll need some specific equipment.

To capture the full arc of the rainbow, you'd need a lens of at least 84
degrees (42 x 2). This would probably require a 19mm wide-angle lens or
something similar for a typical DSLR.

## What's your favorite rainbow-related character?

Definitely Lady Rainacorn.
