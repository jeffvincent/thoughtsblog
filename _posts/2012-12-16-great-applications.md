In the two years I've been at Wistia (wow), we've added ten new people. This
actually doesn't sound as herculean of a task as it has felt
(shoot, I should have covered that in percentages...200% growth!).
I've reviewed the resumes of every single successful applicant, and also
countless resumes that unfortunately didn't make the cut. This doesn't make me
an expert, but it does make me opinionated {{ ":wink:" | emojify }}.

These are some of my opinions on applications. The goal, is sharing them, is
mutually beneficial: I want the best people for the job to rise to the top,
and I also want to spend time looking at really good applications.

Before I get started, I want to make sure this is abundantly clear: **I am
very aware of just how lucky we are to receive so many applications for open
positions**. It is a humbling experience to hear from a large volume of excellent 
candidates how badly they want to work with you, and we as a company are fortunate
to be in that position. It is also surprising that many folks *want* to join our
wacky band of caffeinated crazy people.

Below are my thoughts, in no particular order.

## You are being evaluated on every possible interaction

Don't forget the number of interactions I can have with your *brand* during the
application process. Yes, the resume, and the cover letter (if included), but also
your twitter feed (*heck, your twitter handle!*), your email address (yep) and the
way you follow up on your application.

Because of our mission to be as picky as possible, we consider everything we can
when evaluating applicants. It easy to remove applicants when it's clear their 
'social media expertise' isn't a reality: their twitter feed is empty and no 
one is listening. Keep this in mind when you get started - you are being evaluated
on much more than your resume.

## Don't overdesign

It makes me really sad to see one of those uber-designed resumes get torn to shreds
by our application queue ([Resumator](http://resumator.com)). The applicant 
clearly spent lots of time getting the social media icons to appear just so, 
choosing the 3-D underline for their name, and reviewing their 'experience section's'
color palette. But the 'resume viewer' is not print - it's margins are a little off,
which destroys the house of cards that is the design.

This overdesign, unfortunately, could also lead to me passing on your resume early.
It gets in the way of the content, which is the whole purpose! This is definitely 
a good time for function over form.

Instead, keep it simple. Some of my favorite resumes have been extremely simple - 
using fonts and weights to highlight, and whitespace to separate. This *cleanliness*
might be a personal preference, but I have to assume it also speaks to how you
handle other tasks.

## Your interests must line up with the role

This one is a tough one. I get so bummed out when we get applications from smart,
experienced folks whose true passion clearly lies somewhere else. Their resume
is full of tiny details to indicate where their passion truly lies - from music to
sports to video producing - and yet they want a role in 'x' (where x is unrelated
to any of those things).

Don't misunderstand this point - I *love* people with hobbies. Everyone in our office
has a side passion they devote time to - Brendan with fly-fishing, Chris with his 
crazy fitness schemes, Jason with near-field electricity. But none of these hobbies
overwhelm their top passion, which is working on solving tough problems and delivering
awesome product to our customers.

Please, don't apply if you won't love the work. Ask me any and every question you need
to determine if you will be happy doing it. I am happy to answer them all completely,
and will only respect you more if the role isn't right for you. But your core interest,
the one that makes you leap out of bed each morning, must be aligned with the role.
Otherwise, you are doomed for burnout or worse - boredom.

## Don't use multiple 'buzzwords' in a sentence

...or at all. When I see the applicant is a "data-driven sales professional bent
on revolutionizing interactions into elegant, cross-vehicle collaborative 
experiences..." they can just stop there. I at least stopped reading it.

In the same way a *true expert* can communicate their focus clearly and simply,
a truly confident and ready-to-contribute applicant doesn't need these terms.
This buzzwordy stuff is not how we talk to each other in the office, so it won't 
give applicants the leg up, either.

Ok, so now you've stripped your resume of buzzwords - how do you make sure it still
stands out? I'll try to provide some tips on that below.

## Not the typical applicant? Don't try to look like one then!

I am totally fine with someone applying with *zero* experience in the role. That
alone will not get you removed from consideration, nor will working in roles or having
degrees that are considered anathema for the startup community (hi, my name is Jeff,
and I have an MBA).  I've always been more interested in the [person underneath](/contrarian-investing-in-people).
If you don't have the experience so far to make you a solid applicant, don't plow
ahead and list unrelated experience on your resume. I glaze right over it.

Instead of sending me the typical role title with three bullets underneath, you
need to take some risks and break out! Specifically, feel free to toss out the resume,
admit to your lack of experience, and instead send me:

* Links to articles you've written that highlight your interest in what the 
position entails. 
* Opinion pieces about the future of support, or why design is becoming so important to startups. 
* Articles you liked, with supporting evidence on what you agree or disagreed with.
* Screenshots of our app or parts of the experience, highlighting what you liked,
or suggesting changes instead (along with reasoning).

## Have references I trust take action on your behalf.

A few months ago, this one wouldn't have gone on the list. I had a really positive 
experience interviewing based on a reference, and now I'm all about it. In this 
networked world of ours, having someone I know (or even somewhat know, i.e. follow
on Twitter) reach out and mention you and how you would fit for the role is so helpful
for me.

It makes it easy for me to say "let's get this person into the office and chat with them"
which means you've crossed the hardest threshold in the entire process. Once you are
in the office, you have the chance to charm us, show off your skills, make us laugh.
Any shortcuts to getting to that point are key.

## Talk to me. Please.

To boil down the above, the resume and cover letter is just another step in the 
interview process. While I wish there was enough time to chat with
each applicant (which would be a great way to get to know them), there just isn't.

Here is my promise to each applicant: I read your resume. I read your answers to
our extra questions too (probably even more closely than I read your resume).

I don't just look at it once, either. I will read through your resume several times,
to make sure I understand you as an applicant, to the best of my abilities.

If after completing this exercise, I don't know much about you and what you stand for,
it's unlikely you will move to the next step. Make sure you the person bubbles up
in your resume, however possible. 

Find out who will *likely* be reviewing your resume, and speak directly to them.
Talk to me like a real person. In particular, think about the following questions,
which are likely to be top-of-mind for me if we were talking in a room together:

**Which experiences of yours would you like to highlight?**

> Those experiences go up top, everything else gets either removed or minified.

**The *why* in your application is so important.**

> Why us? When there are lots of other (higher paying) jobs to be had, why is our small company so attractive?

**Specific thoughts on the role and position.**

> "sales expert" really doesn't tell me much. We do sales a bit differently than most,
do you think that lines up? Are we doing sales wrong, and if so, how would you help fix
them? I'm totally attracted to being challenged in a resume - make me think!

I really hope this helps. It's very upsetting to read posts by folks complaining
about the number of resumes they receive, or boasting of how little time they have
to review candidates. For the right candidate, I would give up an entire day, no
question. Hiring and growing the team correctly are simply that important. The key
then, for the applicant, is to make it easier for me to know you are the right one!
