title: Giving Honest Feedback

  The feedback process is a key piece in our focus on the growth of
  our teammates. Some thoughts on how we do it.

We’ve been doing some feedback rounds at Wistia, and I’ve had the chance to
participate in a few of them. These feedback rounds are such a big deal: we
don’t do them often, which means they have an outsized effect on that person’s
growth and outlook (this immediately highlights an opportunity to conduct these
more often).

I spent a long time thinking and reviewing one Wistian’s feedback in
particular - he is someone I admire and spend my time working with. While he
and I have lots of honest conversations, the formal feedback sessions provide
more _oomph_, so I wanted to be thoughtful and thorough.

In our follow-up conversation, we were able to get to even more depth. Since
then, our working (and personal) relationship has improved, which will lead
directly to measurably better (faster, higher quality, more impactful) output.

In reflecting on my experiences with the feedback process, a few things that
stick out to me:

1. **Use a consistent process.** We’ve approached feedback with the same
process for years: one person is organizing the feedback, they survey a panel
of peers using similar questions, they formulate and share the feedback. We
look to avoid changing our starter questions, unless there is a clear purpose.
This ensures people across the company have similar experiences. This doesn’t
mean we only cover those questions - they are meant to stimulate thought and
cover all the bases.
2. **When your friends and those you respect ask for
feedback, they don’t want you to hold back.** Great people and friends want to
improve, and if they are asking for it honestly, they trust your opinion.
Respect that by taking the time to think about your feedback for them, and
speak openly. Help them identify what their highest contributions are, where
they are being held back, and where they might be holding others back.
3.  **When giving feedback (positive or negative) include how their behavior
makes you _feel_.** While some might tell you should keep feelings out of
professional feedback, I strongly disagree. Emotions are extra connective
tissue the feedback receiver can use to internalize and create new behaviors
around the feedback.

It feels _really good_ to give feedback that has an impact. When you see that
person grow and challenge themselves, you feel a sense of leverage - you played
a part in their journey.

What does your feedback process look like?
