For the last week, Marisa and I were in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, enjoying the
beautiful scenery and of course the skiing.

Early in the trip, a small emergency broke out at work. Despite the best
efforts of both my team and our CEO Chris, I had a small panic attack. I found
myself distracted for the entire day - checking email constantly, thinking
myself in circles, unable to sleep.

By 3am, I was driving myself mad - on one hand, I was worried that I was far
away and unable to make the impact I wanted, and on the other hand, I was
worried I was going to ruin the rest of the trip with crushing anxiety.

So I followed my own advice, pulled out my phone, and opened 
[Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/). I spent the next hour huddled in the dark,
writing every thought that came to my mind about the situation in a diary
entry.  Different perspectives, mini-issues, and action steps became clear in
my mind.  I saw the causes of the issue, and the solutions - both quick and
long-term.

I had been so tense, I could actually feel myself unwind. I was taking deeper
breaths, my brain was slowing down. When I was done, I turned off my phone and
fell asleep.

The next day we woke up, ate a big breakfast, and skied the hardest line I'd
ever skied. It was a really thrilling experience that reminded me I was alive
and there was more to life than just the minutiae of the moment. It sounds
weird, but I realized I was breathing again.

It's not like the issue just went away after that. The rest of the trip I
remained aware of it, but I felt in control. I could spend a moment dwelling on
it, and then put it away to be there during dinner, reading, or just taking a
walk. I had assembled my mental notes, and had put away those feelings that can
overtake you in the immediate moment.

The most valuable advice I got during that issue: When you are in your recovery
time, be in your recovery time.

If you can't find the opportunity to recover, you'll only be further underwater
mentally when you return, which makes the vacation mostly useless.

It doesn't mean urgent situations won't come up. When they do, take that
opportunity to really think, rather than jump into action like you might when
on the job. Document the issue, communicate, and lean on your teammates. Both
you and your team will be stronger as a result.

*Thanks to everyone who gave me advice and supported me in being on vacation.
Feels great to be back!*
