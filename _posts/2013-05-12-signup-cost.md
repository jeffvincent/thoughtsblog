  There is a lot of thought and effort devoted to conquering the effort and
  friction involved in using a product. I don't think enough effort is
  dedicated to overcoming the costs/friction of the sign-up process.

I have a very love/hate relationship with email, as I suppose pretty much
everyone does. On one hand, it gets the job done. On the other hand, it demands
constant attention and (at least for me) creates a psychological weight (see
[inbox guilt](http://carokopp.com/post/41069593202/inbox-guilt-psychology)).

So when I give up my email address for a new service or newsletter, I'm just
the slightest bit nervous. "Am I about to be spammed? Is this worth adding to
my inbox load?" are the questions going through my head.

That is why I'm such a huge advocate for sign-up flows that **return immediate
value**. Giving the new audience member something of value right away erases the
possibility of "buyer's remorse" and can turn them into an advocate fast.

Here are two examples of this theory in action:

**Wistia Sign-up Flow**

<div class="post_image"><img src="http://embed.wistia.com/deliveries/1d5bdeb771e88586b7b1d8eb627e4e5ecf3eb793.png" alt="wistia sign up thanks" /></div>

After you entrust us with your email info and create your
[Wistia](http://wistia.com) account, you land on the account thanks page. We
struggled a bit with what to put on this page - we couldn't direct you straight
into your account, because you need to activate by email (so we know you are
real), but we also know if you don't end up in your account *soon*, you might
forget we even exist.

The idea of a "thank you and welcome" type video was not widely loved at first, 
but now it is firmly part of our digital personality. By putting the entire
team's faces in the video, new customers get started creating a relationship
with us right away - and we get to introduce them to our goofy humor.

The entire video took less than a day to concept, shoot, and edit (probably
less than 2 hours, really) but has paid huge dividends. We get emails all the
time from new customers saying it helped affirm them that signing up was the
right choice (awesome!).

**Wistia Video Marketing 101**

(sorry for the epic thumb Chris {{ ":smiley_cat:" | emojify }})

The [Video Marketing 101](http://wistia.com/content/vm101/) series was our
first foray into educational content. When we wrapped on the final video, and
got ready to launch the series as a drip campaign, we didn't have a solid plan
for what would happen immediately after sign-up. There was a confirmation page,
sure, but that just said a quick *thanks* - subscribers could have to wait a
whole month before they received their first installment.

We needed to capitalize on their excitement for the content, and communicate
our sincere enthusiasm for being able to share this info with them. We shot the
"Thank You For Signing Up" video in less than an hour. It stars Chris (who
would then lead viewers through the rest of the series as well) speaking
briefly about what the series would cover. He even includes his contact
information, in case viewers had further questions after watching (he still
gets emails and calls, a year and a half after launch!).

While it might not work for every "sign-up" experience, here are some quick and
simple ideas for your Post Sign-up content:

* Newsletter:
  * a *greatest hits list* email
  * a canned email that details why you started the Newsletter in the first
  place and what you hope to accomplish
  * landing page with links to other high-quality email newsletters I might
    want to try out, or products your subscribers love
* Service:
  * landing page with a call-to-action on what they should do first
  * an email with links to popular blog posts
  * landing page video with instructions on how to get started

---

We do a lot of work just *before* the sign-up to encourage conversion. We
optimize webpages, we A/B test calls-to-action, we try to address their questions
and concerns about the service right there on the page, we whittle down the
amount of info we require to make it frictionless. Let's not forget the moment
just *after* the transaction occurs. Make your new fans feel special, and they
will reward you by shouting from the rooftops!

    I used MailChimp in the example of a sign-up form,
    but this post is not meant as a critique of their sign-up flow.
    Quite the contrary, I think they do a lovely job.
