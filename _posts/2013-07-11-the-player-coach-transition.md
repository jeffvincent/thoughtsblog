The last six months or so have been full of learning and transition. At the
start of 2013, my time was mostly spent in our support inbox, communicating
with dozens of customers every day.

Jordan, who joined our team in December, quickly took on the lion-share of the
inbox, giving me more time to tackle tough technical issues and other projects.

Then in May, Mercer joined our merry band. As we were a bit more experienced
bringing in new customer happiness team members, I'd like to think we did a
half-way decent job. Mercer started answering customer questions on her first
day, and never looked back.

I quickly began noticing Jordan and Mercer were doing a much better job in the
inbox than I ever did - they were calm, empathetic, and clear in their emails.
Customers were happy, even without me. It was time for me to hand over control
of my beloved inbox.

I won't lie, that was tough.

I've always enjoyed being a bench player around the company, helping Joe and
Liat in design, or taking on small-but-necessary dev projects. I suddenly found 
myself with time for lots of new projects. The prospect of this sounded
incredibly exciting!

But design and development projects were often slower-going. I would spend an
entire day messing about with styles or troubleshooting a technical issue.
While support emails are a grind, the instant gratification you get from
solving customer problems is *addictive* and hard to transition away from. I
couldn't shake the nagging feeling I was now worth much less to the company.

Chris, his "employee struggling" spidey sense no doubt tingling, sat me down and
helped me sort out my new role. I would act as a boots-on-the-ground contributor
in some areas, and a mentor in others. He defined it as being a *player-coach*. 
This perspective has helped me categorize and prioritize my work, and has led
to another awesomely productive period.

Here's how I do it:

## Categorize and Prioritize

At the start of each week, I lay out my goals. I organize them
into *player* activities and *coach* activities. For example, last week I
finished our implementation of the awesome [MailView gem](http://github.com/37signals/mail_view)
(player activity) and also worked with Max to better analyze our pre-sales
communication activities (coach activity).

It can be easy to slot projects I can do alone above those that require
organization and planning with others (I'm not as good with that). Thinking
about each item in terms of priority, and whether I was acting as a bottleneck,
helped me identify what to get done and when. It helps that our team is as
obsessed with execution as I am. Once I got the ball rolling, I could trust the
other team members would crush their individual parts and produce something of
high quality for our customers.

## It's Mentoring, Not Managing

As a company organized with a very flat structure, the idea of *managing*
people made me cringe. I go to great lengths to remind the Customer Champs that
while I will try to lead them, and will always fight for them, it is not my
role to manage their output.

Ben spent time helping me understand how to *mentor*, imparting my experience
and sharing my opinions, without becoming an insufferable tyrant. I'm sure I
have lots left to learn, but the feedback so far has been very positive.

To make sure I'm being clear, here is a real-life example: I started organizing
a monthly customer happiness meeting for the four members of our Customer
Happiness team (myself, Max, Jordan, Mercer). Last meeting, we spent a good
amount of time discussing the future of our pre-sales process. My opinion wasn't
necessarily the *winner* (wouldn't that be nice?) and my vote carries no more than
anyone else. That being said, I could provide Max insight from my time in both
the pre-sales and support, and I'd like to think that helped.

## Take Time for Long-Term Thinking

When the inbox was a constant concern, I found it very difficult to take a few
minutes to breathe and think about the future. While it is my natural tendency
to identify inefficiencies and destroy them, taking the time to plan out more
dramatic changes was not.

Chris was always pressuring me to think about the future of support and
customer happiness - what it would look like it we had more resources. This was
a struggle - I'd often find myself back in the inbox, answering emails "while I
thought about it."

I was also horribly allergic to meetings of any sort. I could feel the inbox
queue growing with each passing minute of even the most productive
conversation. This led to some poor communication and a real lack of
collaboration. While this helped me alleviate [inbox guilt]() in the
short-term, it didn't help elevate our customer experience at all.

A brilliant customer experience relies on customer happiness, development,
marketing, and design working (and yes, meeting) together. We've got some
awesome stuff planned for our customers in the coming months, and it wouldn't
be possible without better long-term thinking.

The dual role of player-coach isn't just for me. In the right environment,
everyone leads, and everyone follows. I'm hoping these tips will help lead you
to an even more productive and happy place.
