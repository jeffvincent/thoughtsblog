  One of the hardest parts about building a team has been learning how to coach
  those who are better than you are.

I played lacrosse in high school. While we weren't the best team in the State
(that award almost always went to a team out in Long Island), we had a flawless
home record - when I graduated we hadn't lost at home in 6 years or something
crazy like that. I played a very small role in that success - what's actually
interesting about this story is our coach.

Coach Rudolph, or Rudy as we called him, was also my U.S. History teacher. He
was not a physically imposing guy - maybe 5'4" and 150 soaking wet. He had a
teacher's disposition and spat a lot while he talked.

Coach Rudolph had never played lacrosse. To my knowledge, he had never played
any sports. But his track record as a coach was unbelievable - his women's
tennis team has *still* never lost a match a home, some years losing barely a
set.

I wish I knew Coach Rudolph's formula. But this post isn't really about analyzing
his leadership style or sussing out some leadership secrets. Instead, it's
about acknowledging what Coach Rudolph was doing then, and what I've felt
challenged with now - what I call **coaching from behind**.

Coach Rudolph couldn't really lead by example, and he couldn't tell us stories
of his legendary victories to gain our respect. We snickered when he ran up and
down the field with a lacrosse stick in his hand, clearly no idea how to use it.
When a ball was thrown his way, he often dropped it, and then had trouble
picking it up.

Instead, I think we trusted Coach Rudolph because he knew our strengths and
weaknesses, and knew how to combine this group of unruly young men together to
**win**.

Today, I'm finding myself unable to always lead by example. My team writes
better emails, identifies flaws in my documentation, and tracks down trickier
technical issues than I ever did. Their time in our support inbox is marked
with huge victories - angry customers turned to evangelists, confused customers
turned into happy (and successful) Wistia users. It's a thing of beauty, and
I'm pretty damn lucky to be able to see it.

I also abhor the idea of gaining my team's respect by reliving old victories
won. I'd prefer to share the relationships with our customers as a team - we've
learned we provide better, more scalable support when customer's don't feel
like they have an *account rep*.

To coach from behind, I need to think about where we're going, and what our
customers deserve from our customer support experience. I need to think about
what this new breed of customer service looks like - Saas companies that want
to stay small, nimble, and happy but still provide the type of
relationship-building service that will help us grow exponentially.

The biggest challenge for me when it comes to coaching from behind is that it's
not my natural strong-suit. I constantly find myself in the weeds on specific
projects that don't lend themselves to high-level thinking or data
gathering. I'm still busy accumulating personal wins and putting out fires,
rather than thinking about the strengths and weaknesses of my team and how
their talents can be combined to make a whole that is greater than the sum of
the parts.

The one thing I do have going for myself is a strong opinionated and well-grounded
intuition. I spent years talking to customers, learning what provided them real
value and what ended up being surface level fluff. My job now is to pass that
along to the team, because they will take my experience and scale it beyond
what I can do alone. Combined with their skills, we can make a pretty
unstoppable force for good.

I've set it as a goal for myself to spend more time listening, more time doing
slight course adjustments, and more time plotting out our next big leaps. If I
truly care about our customers getting the fastest, highest-quality help,
that's my best course forward.

If I can provide a strong vision, and if I can communicate where we should end up
and why that will mean success for us, I can set a path that we all walk
together. It's a pretty awesome gig if you can get it {{ ":smiley:" | emojify }}.
