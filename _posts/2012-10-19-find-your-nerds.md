<p class="disclaimer">Before I start this post, I want to make sure you know: I am a nerd. I love nerds and everything nerdy.</p>

If you remember high school, you remember the cliques: the band geeks, theater nerds, computer nerds, running geeks, jocks, etc.

Now fast forward to today. Some of us are still passionate about those same topics, some have picked up new ones. Those passions have become hobbies and businesses. There are SEO nerds, startup nerds, alcohol nerds *(I hear they prefer “buffs”...whatever, nerd)*, the list goes on and on. And **I believe the best way to market is to find them and speak directly to them.**

Like many startups, we are struggling with visibility: we are confident in our software, and can't wait for new people to try it and see what it can do for their business. *But how do we get the message out?*

Huge ad buys is a possibility - a lot of our customers read publications like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. We could also use paid acquisition to bring in new customers. It's not a bad approach, but it's questionable how these work in the long-term, and what kind of customer base they build.

Instead, we went and found the small niches who would devour information on the topics we were experts at. We became a teaching company, and we started producing excellent content. **We found our nerds.**

Looking back, this is a bit intuitive. When the buying decision is being made, the nerds are the ones championing your product, holding up blog posts and video content as the evidence that yours is the horse to back.

If you are struggling to make great content, you aren’t making it for your nerds. Nerds will laugh at your corny jokes, they will work their way through thick, detailed guides, hell, they will even watch videos over 2 minutes in length! They love hearing you say, "We're just trying this as an experiment, to see if it works." This indicates they are part if the learning experience, part of the journey. Nothing excites a nerd more than the ability to learn.

One of the hardest parts about focusing on content to drive the business is the feedback part. This post was liked *x* number of times, that one was tweeted *y* times, what does that mean? What is success? This is not a problem if you are speaking to your nerds. They will comment, ask for more information, start a conversation on Twitter, looking to uncover those nuggets that will push their own practice further. The Twitter followers of successful nerds swell with those looking for ways to improve themselves.

But, you say, my business isn't fun and cool. There are grass growing nerds, horse raising nerds, house shutter nerds. You name it, they are out there. Find the right circles, and your content will strike a chord with it’s message.

Who would have thought there was something cool in sending email or improving search engine rankings? Probably no one before the teams at MailChimp and SEOMoz showed us how. Now, both of those companies are respected, revered, and dare I say it...*pretty damn sexy.*

Ever seen a MailChimp post? They are filled with data on topics like [subject line length](http://blog.mailchimp.com/this-just-in-subject-line-length-means-absolutelynothing/) and [open rates](http://blog.mailchimp.com/hugh-macleods-social-objects-and-fantastic-open-rates/), but they are fun and conversational. Their posts also have rich discussions in the comments - nerds wanting more. MailChimp is just plain killing it right now, and probably has some of their more staid competitors pretty worried about what they will do next.

Ok, you're sold on the search for nerds to drive your marketing efforts. **So how does one go about finding these nerds?** It certainly helps to start as one. If you aren’t, hire as many epically nerdy, weird people as you can (just my opinion). Go to where nerds are congregating, whether that be a physical place, a message board, conventions, whatever, and then talk to them. Get their opinions on your idea. Find out what excites them - ammo for later content.

Once you have found your voice, finding more nerds for your audience will not be a problem: each piece of excellent content you produce will move you further into their lexicon, higher on their list of trusted sources. They will share your content with fellow nerds - it is exciting to find someone who speaks to them! I know I follow companies like [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/blog), and [Intercom](http://blog.intercom.io/), because their content helps make me better at my job. And I get to be a nerd at work (pretty awesome).

**I am so pumped for the day when the truly successful companies are also making content for nerds like me**. Please, do your business a favor, and follow these tips when making awesome content for your nerds (much of this was learned the hard way):

## Don’t Make it For the Mainstream
I’ll say this for my experience in front of a video camera: when you’re not being authentic and talking about something you care about, it shows. And when you try to straddle multiple audiences, your message will become murky and inauthentic. And it's no wonder why - how many of us have ever spoken to the “mainstream”? But nerds we've spoken to - at meet-ups, conventions, in comment threads on Hacker News. We can talk with them in same easy manner we talk to our co-workers with.

One caveat on this: make absolutely, positively sure that you explain any lingo you use. If you truly understand the subject matter, you should be able to explain it simply.

## Make it Valuable
Fluff pieces are uninteresting to your nerd groups. Because they have a list of other sources to turn to, they will tune you out once you stop giving them something actionable. So do real research, and give them an open window into your experience.

I know at times we have struggled with giving away our secrets. But the truth is, some of them aren't secrets at all: they are lessons learned through effort, trial and error. Your true followers will appreciate this, and their loyalty will only grow.

## Learn From the Feedback
Listen and respond to the comments that come in. If there are points unclear in your content, clarify them and consider updating the post. If there are suggestions for future content, make sure your marketing team sees them!

It's hard at first; not many comments come in for most posts. We often kick-start the comments process by chiming in unprompted, continuing our office banter on a comment thread of a brand new post. I believe participating in the comment process, answering honestly and completely where you can, and following through by creating content your nerds want is the best way to build an active following.

**Good luck!** While I can't promise you riches from this approach (after all, I don't have any yet), I can tell it is so much more fun and rewarding to make content for your nerds. At the end of the day, fun is what we are here for.
