I'm so excited to say we're on the hunt for a new **Customer Champion** 
to join our merry band {{ ":metal:" | emojify }}

**Customer Champion is a tough job:** they are the conduit between ourselves and
our customers. They spend most of the day talking to current and prospective 
customers, whether it's through support emails, phone calls, or Twitter conversations
([@jordanmunson](http://twitter.com/jordanmunson) crushes it at that).

We named the role **Customer Champion** because *first*, it's silly, and we're
all about silly, and *second*, Champion really does describe the job pretty accurately.

The Customer Champion's represents customers needs as we consider new features.
They are always on top of questions like: 

<blockquote>What do our customers dream about? What would make their lives better?</blockquote>

Below are a bunch of thoughts on why being a **Customer Champion** at 
[Wistia](http://wistia.com) rocks {{":metal:" | emojify }}


### Level Up Your Skills

The current Customer Champions have invested themselves in learning how to read
and write code - mostly front-end (CSS, javascript) but some back-end as well 
(Ruby). This is critical from a support perspective, because it means *escalation*
is no longer necessary to solve problems. 

Javascript breakdown? We can handle that in the first conversation. Styling 
conflicts? No problem. No more of those annoying "pinball" support experiences, 
where the customer is passed around from department to department.

This gives our customers peace of mind. They can concentrate on their business -
we got the video stuff covered {{ ":smiley:" | emojify }}

We pledge to get our Customer Champion team access to the best tools available. 
We're already using awesome tools like Code School and GitHub to make this happen.


### Support is the Center of the Action

Our new **Customer Champion** joins a team that is obsessed with providing top-notch 
support. We don't separate support into a call center. No micro-management or strict 
regulation either - just the ability to do right by the customer.

When we recently asked our customers what they loved most about the Wistia experience,
they chose support. We're building a business driven by great support interactions,
and as **Customer Champion** you'd be in the front seat.

Too often, I hear about support teams that are stuck out on an island, separated 
from the rest of the team. That ain't gonna fly with us. We lean heavily on tools
like Campfire, Yammer, and iDoneThis to keep others in the loop. We also work in 
tight quarters, so that experience and expertise can more easily flow between team 
members. Everyone gets the support they need.


### Automation is Expected

A wise man once said, "it's foolish to do the same job, day in and day out."
Our Customer Champions are vigilant for ways to automate themselves away, because
we believe **the best support is no support at all**. 

We've kept our team small, which means automation is a must. when you automate 
away the immediate issues, you free yourself up to take on even harder problems. 
Those who desire role security above all else need not apply. 


### The Wistia Team

I believe in our team because we make it awesome, and we give a shit.

We're an extremely productive and tight-knit team that takes care of 
each other and our customers. That formula has proven itself pretty effective -
we're growing like wild and our customers love the brand more than ever. We also 
do stuff like play ping-pong, go on hikes, ski, play video games, and teach each 
other new skills.


### Become the Next Customer Champion

Our type of support will never be easy. Additional smart and passionate folks 
will help distribute the load. New ways to educate (improved onboarding, better 
documentation, and more informative error handling) will even erase some issues 
altogether. But it will never be easy. 

That's why our **Customer Champions** are so important. They handle our customer's
problems with a perfect harmony of skill and smiles. By our count, few support
teams have ever been set up this way. Consider it a "dare to be great" situation.

If you got jazzed up by what I've said above, [you should join us]() {{ ":guitar:" | emojify }}
