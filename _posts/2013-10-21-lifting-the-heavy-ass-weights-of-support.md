  I gave a talk at UserConf 2013 in San Francisco.

UserConf 2013 in San Francisco was an absolute blast! I made a bunch of new
friends, got to hear some great speakers, and was able to talk about what I
call the Heavy Weights approach.

My big takeaway, after digesting all the talks and some of the post-conference
chats as well:

> Automate where you can, be intensely human wherever you can't

The slides from my talk, "Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support", are below.
Check them out, and then the Q&A that follows - I'm going to address some of
the great questions I received via twitter and email.

## Questions!

Here are some great questions I received post-talk.

**What is 'App Sanding'? (slide 24)**

I didn't speak to that specifically in my talk, which I'm bummed about because
clearly it was a bit confusing.

*App Sanding* means finding places in our customer's experience that aren't
quite right. These might come up from support emails, or just from poking
around.

The example that comes to mind right now is our password reset email. The old
language said "Your account has now been reset".

Account reset? To what? If I received that I would freak out. It's about
finding places that generate a few emails here-and-there, but can cause
confusion or add up to a frustrating experience.

**When you find things to automate, who does it?**

This part really depends on what we're looking to automate. If it's something
messaging-wise, like a documentation change or an error message, that is
normally headed up by the Customer Happiness team. *Example:* To reduce emails
related to failed uploads, we added an Uploads Troubleshooting doc page, and
link to it from an uploads failure message in-app.

If it is something more in-depth, for example improving our encoding processes
to reduce failures, that is something we'd work with a member of the
development team on. Communicating what needs to be done and how much pain it
is causing our customers is critical in getting buy-in.

**What's the process for developing a new resource?**

First, four steps for developing static content.

1. *Clarify and understand the problem:* Make sure you have a good
  understanding of how the problem manifests itself, who experiences it, and
  how often.
2. *Identify where current options fall short:* If we already have a resource
  in-place, why isn't that doing the job? Is it out-of-date, confusing, in the
  wrong place?
3. *Find a place for it to live:* Content must have a consistent presentation
  spot in order to drive value.
4. *Make it!* Start writing / shooting / recording.

Now let's talk *making stuff*.

Determine who should be involved - which depends on your situation, and the
content that needs to be made. For us, if the content is specific to teaching
the customer how to use the app, we can probably run the show.

If the content involves a new web presence, especially one on our marketing
site, then we need the marketing team. Either way, we communicate with them
constantly, to get their input and make sure we're on the same page.
