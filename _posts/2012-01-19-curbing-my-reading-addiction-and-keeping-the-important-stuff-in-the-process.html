<div class='posterous_autopost'><div style="margin:8px;">  <p>I have a problem. &nbsp;I'm addicted to reading. &nbsp;While it doesn't do much damage to my health, if left unchecked it drains time away from my other favorite things to do (like exercise and time with loved ones). &nbsp;Constant access to the internet is like a crack den for someone with a reading addiction. &nbsp;When I was in grad school, my range on interests expanded while I wrestled with what to do after school. &nbsp;From finance to tech news, venture capital to marketing, my Google Reader account was constantly stuck at '1000+'. &nbsp;With a bit of free time on my hands every day, I got to the point where I was 'reading' 400+ articles per week, and skimming hundreds more. &nbsp;I was subscribed to dozens of blogs and news sites, and constantly balancing on the edge of being completely overwhelmed by the barrage of content. &nbsp;The worst part was my lack of retention - I felt almost powerless to actually read and understand -- my tiny brain was full to the read line. &nbsp;I was saturated.</p>  <p>My girlfriend finally staged an intervention. &nbsp;Well, she removed the Google Reader plugin from my browser, which acted as an intervention. &nbsp;Without the constant reminder that I was leaving hundreds of articles unread, my addiction to clearing my Reader list was curbed. &nbsp;While I still devoured lots of articles, I no longer used an RSS reader to aggregate them.</p>  <p>With starting at Wistia, I took another big step - I stopped following blogs altogether. &nbsp;I deleted all my bookmarks, and instead used my Twitter feed to tell me what to read. &nbsp;The integration with Instapaper made it easy - if I saw an article in my timeline that looked interesting, I could add it to my Instapaper list with a simple swipe (nevermind the fact that Twitter has since made this much more difficult).</p>  <p>I can't lie - I still obsess over clearing my Instapaper queue. &nbsp;But with 1,300+ articles in my to-read list, this isn't happening anytime soon. &nbsp;But I was in control of what articles went into my queue, which was much more efficient. &nbsp;There was always one problem with this setup - I was missing out on the updates of my favorite blogs. &nbsp;My friend Courtney's blog? &nbsp;Never one of the popular articles in my Twitter feed. &nbsp;I was also always hunting for a article to read with my coffee - just trying to clean out my Instapaper queue left me with only long articles.</p>  <p>That's when I heard about <a href="http://ifttt.com" target="_blank">ifttt</a> (If This Than That). &nbsp;I tugged on my imaginary beard as I read over the description of the service. &nbsp;And I knew it would make my reading problem go away...at least partially. &nbsp;Who knows if sending this ifttt recipe out will work, but here is my favorite: <a href="http://ifttt.com/tasks/510196" target="_blank">http://ifttt.com/tasks/510196</a>. &nbsp;I created a folder in my old Google Reader account called "must reads", and now whenever an item gets added to that folder, it gets auto-added to my Instapaper queue. &nbsp;Ahhh, efficiency.</p>  <p>So, you might be wondering, what's in my "must reads" folder? &nbsp;Well, besides some personal blogs, here's the current list:</p>  <ul>  <li><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/" target="_blank">Seth's Blog</a> - Godin just knows how to get me pumped, and he does it concisely (something I wish I did better)</li>  <li><a href="http://learntoduck.com/" target="_blank">Learn to Duck</a> - Micah Baldwin's blog. &nbsp;Love his stuff - just so honest.</li>  <li><a href="http://www.jasonshen.com/" target="_blank">Art of Asskicking</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/JasonShen/" target="_blank">Jason Shen</a> is the man. &nbsp;He makes me aware of what I can do if I focus.</li>  <li><a href="http://howardlindzon.com/" target="_blank">Howard Lindzon's blog</a> - A serious straight-shooter in the world of finance, and Stocktwits is just killing it.</li>  <li><a href="http://thestartupdaily.com/" target="_blank">The Startup Daily</a> - Brings you a quote from a book every day. &nbsp;So far, pretty neat.</li>  <li><a href="http://rogerandmike.com/" target="_blank">Roger and Mike's Hypernet blog</a> - <a href="http://rogerandmike.com/post/13134465226/heres-roger-at-tedxsantacruz-talking-about" target="_blank">Roger McNamee's TED Talk</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorites, and he and Mike Maples Jr. are building an awesome blog.</li>  </ul>  <p>For anyone out there with a reading addiction like mine, I highly recommend checking out Instapaper (as if you aren't already using it) and ifttt - the combo together is what you need to get your life and attention span back.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>        </div>
