<p>I was chatting with a friend the other night at our holiday party. She said she'd been hearing more and more young people idolizing startups. It seemed everyone she was talking to was going to start their own company or join a startup. She lamented that many of them had no idea what a startup was, or what their (venture-backed) business would do. This got me thinking...if someone had sat me down a few years ago and told me I'd be working at a "startup", would I have had any idea what that meant?</p>  <p>When I was working on the draft for this post, I came across a post by the same title ("What is a Startup?" by Daniel Tenner: <a href="http://swombat.com/2011/12/17/what-is-a-startup">http://swombat.com/2011/12/17/what-is-a-startup</a>). I recommend checking it out - it's excellent analysis on defining a "startup". His definition is really well-thought out and inclusive:</p>
<blockquote>"An impossible list of things to do in an impossibly short amount of time, with scant resources...oh and the heater isn't working."</blockquote>
<p>In some general ways, life in our office isn't that different from a normal job. We drink lots of coffee, chat about our favorite movies, and we work. A lot. The difference is in the culture - the responsibility portion specifically. That impossible list of things to do? Most of them have to be self-assigned. You can't wait for someone to ask you to do something - because it's not coming. A management role has to be about coaching, focusing, and supporting - not directing.</p>
<p>That impossibly short time-line? That's because there are competitors. Lots, if you're in the right market. And they want to crush you as bad as you want to succeed. Some are big - they think of you as a group of crazy people trying to scale the wall of their fortress. Some are small, and hungry, just like you. While you can respect what they do, don't ever get too comfortable - they'll take you out if they get the chance. Sorry, that's just business.</p>
<p>I also didn't mention that those scant resources have to be fought for. Money, time, skills - all are in short supply. So be prepared to argue for why your project is worthwhile. This is a good thing for the future of the company - it means the best projects have been chosen (hopefully).</p>
<p>In a startup, there's also this prevailing feeling of no safety net below you. The work we do is ours, and if it fails...it's really on us. Not in a "manager is gonna yell at you" way, like in a "party's over" kinda way. This 'no safety net' feeling can be a bit scary, especially when you make decisions or try things you don't know will work. But it also drives you to execute. Clear an inbox of 40+ support items in a morning? No problem. Solving a scary, ugly problem for a customer in a way you know will delight them, in a timeframe that will help their business? Done. Work until 10pm with an international customer, sending screen captures back-and-forth to understand what horrible things their niche CMS is doing toour poor embed codes? Happy to do it. Because there is no other option, you are freed up to do the one thing you can do - and that is move forward.</p>
<p>Life in a startup can be loud. Really loud. Phones ringing, people arguing, music blaring loud. When it's Friday AM, and customers want to make sure their new video campaign is embedded correctly for a Monday launch - the phones are ringing off the hook. And we answer them. All of them. When it's Wednesday afternoon, and some employees from a nearby startup want to come by and share marketing stories - we host them. When it's 3PM on a Saturday and between working on side-projects you're blasting video game zombies in the basement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking of startup life when everyone was making a big deal about the Tom Brady/Bill O'Brien blow-up a few weeks back. They are yelling at each other because they are both passionate and want to win so bad it hurts. They can hug it out later - and mean it - because it is that exact passion that allows them to succeed. It can be ugly, but they need it.</p>
<p>
<p>Life in a startup can also be dead silent. When it's "headphones-on" time in the office, and everyone is just getting their stuff done. It's not entirely out-of-the-question to go days without talking at length to someone else (and in a tiny office, that's almost hard). Because of the amount of work to do, we can't be involved in all parts of the business. Sometimes when you're planning the next project, it can just be you. Time can fly right by, which can make you feel pretty isolated.</p>
<p>Startups are both a community and an island. We can support each other, spend time away from work with each other, and help spread experiences/knowledge with each other. But when it comes to defining our business, talking to our customers, designing the roadmap - that's all on us. No one else can do it for you. There's plenty of time to be social, but it can be good to just work too.</p>
<p>Being in a startup means I get to see the future. I get to see what our incredible dev team is working on long before it makes it to the product. I know what is possible a long time before it's ever made a reality. When we hold Wistia U, I get to learn new skills from some of the best in the biz. It's an absolute dream of a position, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>Now along with defining what a startup is, it's probably important to define what a startup isn't. A startup isn't a 9 to 5 job. I've heard some folks say it is, or that it should be, and it sounds like that's good for them (I should add their business is doing quite well). But if you're at a startup, and you've got major incumbents, with deep pockets, hell-bent on your destruction, and you're clocking out at 5 every day? I don't think you've set your sights high enough.</p>
<p>A startup isn't a movie. Sure, we get excited watching Glengarry Glen Ross or Boiler Room, just like anyone else. But most startups don't work like they depict in the movies - because the movies don't depict most startups. They depict the outliers. Please don't get that part confused.</p>
<p>A startup also isn't a normal job. Because we'd suck at a 'normal' job. 'Normal' jobs are where playing it conservative is the right path, where you might actually be penalized for working too much, where management just wants their damn bonus. Normal jobs can be filled with nonsensical meetings, asinine rules, and mis-aligned incentives. &nbsp;Normal jobs are also much safer. &nbsp;You can clock out, go walk the dog, make a full dinner, get a workout in, maybe watch some Modern Family. &nbsp;Normal jobs (should) provide a clearer future and career path. &nbsp;If you like the idea of all that - check out a normal job.</p>
<p>We're at a startup because we care too much. We want to win so bad we'll never give up. &nbsp;Hopefully somewhere in my thoughts, you'll find something that will help you decide if a startup is for you.</p>
