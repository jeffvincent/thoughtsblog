When I was working as a chef, our head chef would routinely demo how we wanted dishes done, or show off new dishes. I would take meticulous notes and ask a lot of (probably stupid) questions. I had a notebook I would tote around with me, where I would jot my notes, to-do lists, and things I needed to learn. The other chefs would laugh at me, saying it was silly to take notes on cooking - it was merely 'an art', and could only be learned over time. Many of them were career chefs, or had been through culinary school, and looked down at my presence. Having gotten the job thanks only to a recommendation from a friend, and never really cooked in my life, I certainly didn't belong. But I enjoyed being in the kitchen and grinding through nightly service, and wanted to do my best.

Now fast forward a year - the other chefs (even the old head chef) were gone, and I was alone running the kitchen. Their lifestyles didn't lend well to consistent, excellent work. They showed up late, they didn't care much, and their food suffered. I should add they were awesome guys, just not great co-workers.

I made my way through the busiest months of the year running a rag-tag group of interim chefs. I learned purchasing, hiring (and firing), and how to do what it takes to get it done. Like many (real) chefs, I bled to get food onto the table. The key? That dog-eared notebook. Without the veteran voices and leadership, I leaned pretty heavily on those pages. Even without really knowing what I was doing, it allowed me to go out and execute, every day. I was clean, organized, and methodical. I refused to get overwhelmed by the situation, which I think is easy to do if you aren't organized.

There is an 'art' to so many things involved in startups, like marketing, development, design, and leadership. Expertise in these areas would take a career to master, but the startup situation doesn't provide that kind of time. To counteract this lack of experience, bring in the organized, methodical thinking of the sciences. Take lots of notes, ask lots of questions, and keep close track of your progress.

So what are some actionable recommendations for doing this? Here's what I've found successful for me:

### Pull the Numbers
Identify your area of influence when it comes to your product and customers, and then pull all the numbers associated with this group. Understand where the bottlenecks are, so you can build an effective attack plan for growth and improvement. You can also look back over time and see the amazing impact your efforts have.

### Journal Your Progress
I have a simple text file where I keep all my numbers and notes. Whenever I make a change, I document why I did it and what I expected to happen. This is pretty close to the lab notebooks I kept in high school and college.

### Ask Questions and for Feedback
One of the best parts about writing notes is the way it forces you to think critically about your actions. Looking back on past decisions, I'm forced to think about what went right, and what went wrong. I have to face the facts about hypotheses that went wrong (or celebrate when they went right). It also makes me more open to feedback, because I have concrete reasons for (most) of the actions I take. This certainly doesn't mean I'm infallible - I still get caught up in my own stuff and make stupid decisions. But I think I'm less defensive because I've thought completely about what I'm doing.
