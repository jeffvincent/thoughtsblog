title: "Court Vision Required"
description:
  We're not looking for someone to come in, do their job, and head out. Vision,
  even short- to mid-term vision, is required.

Periodically, we review what makes a great employee at Wistia. We look at who
has struggled, who has thrived, and try to determine *why*.

We're not very good at micro-managing (I am, in particular, poor at it).
By-and-large, people at Wistia set their own to-do lists, and we trust them to
do the right stuff. We've done a good job hiring people who are self-directed
and succeed in that environment.

When someone is struggling, we look for what's missing. We've always been pretty
fixated on the idea of **ownership**. Ownership over a project, or a part of
the total customer experience. Responsibility is driven by ownership - if you
have the ability to set the scope, you know what needs to be done.

*Ownership alone is standing still*. Simply knowing what needs to be done, and
plowing forward on it, is not enough to produce inspiring work. It's not enough
to motivate your co-workers to plot and scheme and produce something awesome
with you.

To remain one step ahead of the game, we need *vision*. We need folks who
continually evaluate what they are working on: how it fits into the company's
mission, how it helps us move forward, how it helps our customers.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying must be a *visionary*, looking deep
into the future to determine how we as a company should act. We'd be pretty
short staffed if that was a requirement - there are not many true visionaries
out there. Having multiple long-term visionaries would also cause a whole host
of problems (too many cooks in our long-term planning kitchen).

Instead, I'm talking about the ability to look around, see how each small action
fits into our long-term vision, and take action when needed.

*Court vision*, in basketball terms, is being able to see the pieces on the
floor, and knowing how they will move. In overused startup parlance, it's
knowing where the puck will be. It's finding the skip-pass that leaves the
defense completely out of position, leading to the easiest, most efficient
points possible (wide-open 3 from the corner, easy weak-side layup, etc.).

Having excellent court vision requires executing well, and taking risks. It
requires leaps of faith, confidence, and speaking out of turn.

To have court vision, you must plunge into the problem, study the options, and take them to
their future conclusions. To tackle new problems, you must think ahead to your
ideal solution, and then lay out the plan to get there. This can sometimes mean
scrapping work, even in full-swing, because it's not the right thing to be doing.

Let me give you an example, to try and drive it home. In support, we're
not here to simply answer emails. I expect every email to come under a certain
amount of scrutiny, i.e. "should we be answering this earlier in the user
experience? If so, where?".

If there is a practice (no matter how entrenched and common practice it is)
that causes more problems than it solves, we should stop it. Conversely, if
there is a new practice we should implement, regardless of the work required to
get it set up, because it is the best way to deliver support, we should do it.
Jordan, Mercer, and Max do a great job identifying what we should be doing,
outside of just responding to emails, in order to improve their lives and
ultimately the customer's lives.

The best support people don't blink at a crushing volume of support - they see
it as solving problems for customers (which is a good and exciting thing for
them). But they will try to get at the root of the problem, and understand what we
should be doing better.

Chris talks about pulling the emergency brake on the train. There is a lot of
momentum that gets built up in our tiny echo chamber, and it can be tough, even
scary, to stop it. To be the one in the way, blocking the path forward. But
when the "brake puller" comes armed with a reasoned argument and a new
recommended path (or some options), it is one of our greatest weapons to be
*able to change course*.

These can be teeny tiny, almost-imperceptible-to-the-outside-world course
corrections. Over a long journey, they add up.
