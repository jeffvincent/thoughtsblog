Team growth presents a whole ton of challenges. One of them is the sharing of
institutional knowledge - how to get the stuff that used to exist in one
person's head into many?

There is no place where this is **more** crucial than in support. Even for a
relatively simple product like ours, there are *dozens*, maybe even *hundreds*,
of potential support scenarios. Training new folks to handle these scenarios is
a herculean task.

Some companies, like MailChimp, solve this with full training programs for new
support folks. This is awesome, but we're still too small for that to work.

When Jordan was first coming on, I was pretty worried about getting him up to
speed. I really didn't want to spend weeks hand holding, to be honest. We hired
Jordan because we thought he would succeed in a totally self-directed
environment, and would be bored and uncomfortable in a hand-holding,
micromanaging environment.

So I started saving some common support questions, and the meat of the answers,
into a document. A support tome, I was calling it. After a few days, the
content volume grew, and I started to group the questions into categories with
their own files.

With some help with my naming compatriot [Max](http://twitter.com/maxschnur),
the name evolved to the Moreau Doctrine (a marriage of two of my favorite
things, [science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau)
and [political policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine)).

Today our support team (myself, Max, Jordan, and Mercer) contribute to the
Moreau Doctrine frequently, and new people can get up to speed quickly by
referring to it.

I've seen lots of guides, internal knowledge bases, and wikis that act like
ghost towns - they are lonely places with out-of-date info and stale language.
Almost a year in, ours is still fun and vibrant {{ ":godmode:" | emojify }}.
Here are some of the lessons I learned in the development of an epic internal
knowledge megatome.

## Go Bare Bones

Don't save your exact responses in a support email doc. The idea is to transfer
the knowledge, not to create canned responses for future emails. I want to
empower new folks to respond to emails, not to force them to adopt my voice & tone.

The test I use is, are these *guidelines*, or *directions*?

If there is only one *correct* way for something to get done (i.e. setting up a 
local version of an app) then of course write up the exact steps.

But if it is something that would benefit from a personal touch (like a support
conversation, blanket customer email, social media interactions) then don't get 
too nitty-gritty. Communicate your thinking and reasoning, and leave the detailed
execution for someone else. Things will almost certainly be different by the time someone
references your megatome, trust them to do the right thing.

## Make it Fun

The biggest problem I've experienced with building a megatome is when it's
there, and it's useful, but no one wants to use it!

For the love of the children, **make sure it's fun to contribute to**. We did
this originally by writing the Moreau Doctrine in markdown (which is a really
easy way to write text) and tracking it via git. New Customer Champions would
be able to learn git while contributing to the doc, which was a fun challenge
and they loved using new technology. Double win.

How else can you make it fun? Make sure the contribution process is as easy as
possible, track & reward contributions, and, if you build a tool, use the most
team-appropriate language possible. Contributing to the Moreau Doctrine sounds
a lot cooler than contributing to the Support Communications Knowledge
Repository.

## Put it in a High-Traffic Area

Make sure your megatome gets contributed to by making sure it gets **used**.
How many times have you dumped important information into a Google Doc, only to
see it get lost in the shuffle?

The Moreau Doctrine benefited from being in our Github account - everyone could
see it and knew what it was. It also existed as markdown files on our
computers, which were easy enough to keep open while we answered support emails.

Now, we've even taken it a step further, with Goose, a super-simple Wiki editor
[Brendan](http://twitter.com/brendan) built. He's been moving towards
open-sourcing it, and when he does I recommend using something like that for
editing.

So that's it, that's all I know. Looking back, most of this advice is pretty
simple and perhaps even obvious. But even the obvious stuff has to be fought
for sometimes. It's too easy to fall into the trap of "just throw it together"
for tough growing pains like sharing internal knowledge. A little advance
planning (and building in fun) will go a long way.
