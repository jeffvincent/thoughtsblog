title: Hand Hold vs. Empower
description: Even as most customers transition to wanting more self-service
  support, we have to address those that demand hand holding.

I've been preparing my talk for [UserConf](http://userconf.co/) for a few weeks
now. A lot of it is spent talking through dialogue by myself, which gets pretty
monotonous. The best part about the experience so far has been the chance to
present the talk to others and get their thoughts. This presentation represents
a lot of my opinions about support, which makes it great starting material for
conversations with some of the smartest support folks I know.

One conversation in particular has stuck in my brain. Somewhere in the
ramblings of my talk, I talk about how our most educated and confident users (I
definitely steal Kathy Sierra's 
[badass user](http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/kathy-sierra-building-the-minimum-badass-user-business-of-software-a-masterclass-in-thinking-about-software-product-development/) 
term) no longer want to be held by the hand and guided when it comes to support.
Sure, they need help from time to time, but they really want resources where
they can solve their own problems.

The question that came up was:

>"what about customers that really do want
personalized, one-on-one support? Do we just abandon them?"

Here's the problem: if we bow to these requests without critically thinking
about them, we are doing the customer *and* ourselves a disservice.

We are conditioning them to contact us (and demand to speak with us, the
hardest communication to scale) whenever they need help. This holds them back
from taking valuable actions in their accounts.

We are preventing ourselves from being able to do next-level work, instead
spending lots of time answering the same questions (many new customers have the
same question).

OK, I know this a gross oversimplification, but looking back at a lot of
these requests, and following through qualitatively on what happened in the
actual conversation, these request break down into two categories.

## The "I Deserve Better Service" Group

The first are people that use this approach with every product they sign up
for. They just believe they deserve better support and contact with the service
provider than anyone else.

Being 100% realistic, at our price points we can't serve these folks all that
well long-term. We are also not built to support a customer base that expects
this, so we're setting ourselves up for failure if we attract and bring on
scores of customers that expect high-touch support. So I'm very reluctant to 
give in to this request.

Instead, I normally approach this using as much of the [talk to the duck](http://hwrnmnbsol.livejournal.com/148664.html)
approach as I can. I explain that I'd like to be prepared for the call they are
requesting, and ask them to put their questions into words. I also set proper
expectations, letting them know we might answer some of their questions by
email, when more appropriate.

7 times out of 10 (that's a guess) they respond with their questions, all of
which can be quickly and clearly clarified by email (supported by links to
relevant documentation, of course). Sometimes they end up becoming a customer, 
sometimes they don't. But we've set proper expectations for them going forward,
which I believe is crucial for creating a relationship both sides can maintain
for the long-term.

## The "I Can't Do It Alone" Group

The second group are folks who really want to make our service work, and they
are just overwhelmed by the whole on-boarding experience. They normally think
they aren't "techie" enough to figure out how to make something like video
hosting work for them.

In many cases, a friend recommended us or a boss figure instructed they
evaluate multiple platforms. They are doing their best to solve their immediate
issue, and they just need a little help.

One of my favorite customers, with whom I converse with by personal email at least
once a month, was once in this group. She had come to us from YouTube, had
recognized some issues with their model, and wanted to learn from the analytics 
we provide.

She was doing her best to get through our documentation, and just needed to
hear a friendly voice reassuring her.

>"Yep, this can be complicated at first. 
Not to worry, we'll get through it together."

We love building a product that makes adding video to your website easy. It's
our goal to empower this group, and move them from a place of feeling inferior
and uneducated, to power users, feeling comfortable and confident getting shit
done using our app.

I see this as evidence that we need to make our resources friendlier and more
approachable, not that we need to provide more hand-holding. We started
creating more [onboarding videos](http://wistia.com/doc/getting-started), which
use lots of Wistia faces, casual and friendly language, and start with the
absolute basics.

## Use Video

Yes, I know, we're a video company and [we make video all the time](http://wistia.com/learning).
But hear me out - video is the best tool you can use to help the *I Can't Do It
Alone* group and scale your Support team's voice.

Video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support. The
viewer gets to watch you complete the actions they are looking to do, which
provides them a clear roadmap to how to get it done.

Video also takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users
with plenty of energy to **go and do** the thing they came to do. Ever read a 
huge text block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? 
OK that's what we want to avoid.

---

Clearer, friendlier, and easier-to-access resources will give our 2nd group an
empowered feeling (and who doesn't want that?). They will thank us with their
business, and by spreading the word about our service.

We will thank them by using our energy to build better resources (i.e. expert
level tutorials on using advanced parts of our app to do amazing things) and by
working with the development team to build a product that delivers them even
more value.

Don't hand hold - look for opportunities to empower wherever possible.
