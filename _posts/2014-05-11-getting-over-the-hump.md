You can almost feel the energy rush out of a room when a boring screencast or
webinar begins. The terrible audio, the near-static visuals, the length. Oh my
god the length.

But this is what we know. This is what we're familiar with, and when discussing
whether to create proactive support videos for our product or service, this is
what our minds immediately go to.

But video is an incredibly important part of the sales and support age we live
in - small web businesses are being held to the same standard as large
corporations with unlimited resources when it comes to the customer service
experience. We need to use scalable educational resources to make sure our
prospective and current customers can use the products we've built, or else
we're dead in the water.

When we were at the San Francisco Zoo for UserConf 2013, I took the stage to
talk about my experience scaling our business with a small support team. I got
**lots** of great questions afterward, but far and away the most popular
question was "how do I get into video?"

What I've learned, and subsequently tried to teach support leaders I come in
contact with, is *making video shouldn't be hard*. Our customers will reward us
for scrappy, lo-fi video production, as long as the videos are short, drive
immediate value (i.e. benefits oriented), and *not boring*.

Making video can seem intimidating - there are many steps involved and planning
work that has to go in ahead of time. As a result, it's easy to prioritize
something like regular support emails, where we can make an immediate and clear
impact, over a "heavy weight" investment like video.

In working with Chris on a number of support videos in the past, we've
developed a process that ensures the *making* of the video itself requires the
least energy possible, which frees me up to think about creative and fun ways
to connect with our audience. The result? Our support videos have become a
competitive edge for our business.

Here are the slides from my talk. The two black slides were placeholders for
videos, the "Masterclass on Private Sharing", and "Get Loose" videos
respectively, which I've included below.

After walking through the slides, how do you feel about making a support video?
What scares you? If you are making support videos now, what do you wish you
knew before you started? Get at me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/jeffvincent) with
