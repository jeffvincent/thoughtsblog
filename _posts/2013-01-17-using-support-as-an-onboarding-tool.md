title: Using Support as an Onboarding Tool
description: 
category: support, startups

I received an awesome email a few weeks back. The sender was interested 
in using support to onboard folks around their (large) company, and in talking
about the benefits we see in taking that approach.

I've never really written my thoughts on that down, so after I finished up my 
response, I've re-written for the blog and posted it here. Can't wait to hear
what you think!

We believe having new hires spend time in the 'support trenches' accomplishes 
a whole bunch of things:

## It teaches them the ins-and-outs of the product.
As a company with only one product, it's pretty darn important for everyone on
the team to know what it does and how it works. 
We also all think differently - what's obvious to [Max](http://twitter.com/maxschnur)
isn't as obvious to me, and so on. 

Being knowledgeable on the product (and it's rough edges) means we can have 
informed debates about the best way to move forward.

## It introduces them to our customers. 
Every business, because of culture, product choices, marketing choices, pricing,
messaging, etc. has built a core audience, some of whom have become customers.

Way back when, we tried to pretend like we were a big company going after 
Enterprise customers - and that's who our audience was (*hindsight: wrong direction!*).

Today, our fanatics are into the fact that we're small, personable, friendly, and fast.
They expect a different type of language and communication than other businesses/apps
might. 

Someone working in marketing or development needs to know that language too, so
that our forward-facing experience remains uniform and creative.

## It introduces them to how we work. 
We're not in it for the quick turnover or the super-fast growth - we want to still
be running this business in 10+ years! The only way to ensure that happens is to
jump in the trenches and *grind* every day.

Yep, that can mean answering the same questions with a smile on your face
(which comes across in your language). Don't have what it takes? You won't last
long (we also only contract-to-hire folks at the start, 3 months, so this is 
actually part of the long-term hire process).

## Technical stuff? Codez? 
When I started at Wistia, my javascript and Ruby skills were definitely lacking.
Because of the issues I was introduced to as part of daily support work, I took
on more and more development. 

While I'm not a Wistia developer by any means (I leave that to more intelligent and focused minds {{"wink" | emojify}})
I commit to our codebase almost every day. Working at a company that produces a web-app,
everyone should be familiar with how that works. They might still look at what our
brilliant developers create and call it "magic", but at least they have a real
idea of the research work and design that went into it.

**Now for some thoughts on how we accomplish this:**

## Write it down. 
In the 'beginning', it was just myself and Ben doing day-to-day support (before me, it was just him!).
This got us pretty far, but it was also pretty far from scalable. Everything I
learned about common problems, answers to common questions, etc. needed to be 
extracted from his brain! 

As I started thinking about growing the support team, I realized we needed a 
knowledge base.  I'm just not patient/free enough to sit with the new person 
and guide them through all the things they'll need to know! 

I started writing a "support tome", which I've given the moniker "the Moreau Doctrine"
(combines a love for classic science fiction with U.S. political history).  
It now has 10 parts, which focus on different support topics (which are app-specific)
and also an "onboarding resources".  

The resources segment I created after our latest support hire, [Jordan]( https://twitter.com/jordanmunson ),
told me it was hard to know which services he needed access to, and who to talk 
to within the company about certain things. Boom, write it down {{ "rocket" | emojify }}.

## Video! 
This piece of advice is a bit self-serving, but I promise is true. There are 
certain actions that are difficult to remember, and usually one person holds it
in their brain (either the person who built it, or the person who originally, 
painstakingly, learned it). 

An example for us is re-encoding a video in our *Bakery* (where new videos are encoded)
or updating transcripts (which are done through a 3rd party app).  I use [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
to record my actions, and just include the music I am currently listening to. 

Super rough, but it works (I can't share any, as they reveal some pretty 
private company info {{ "smiley" | emojify }}). Ping me if you need more info.

## Open communication. 
I wasn't sure if this part was actually necessary, but what the heck this email 
is already super long. As I mentioned before, I'm not patient about sitting with
someone and walking through support requests, but I **do** make myself 
completely available to them.  

Short of me actually speaking with a customer, anything I am doing can and should
be interrupted for support issues. I'm also a pretty goofy guy, and I hope that 
means people find it easy to ask me questions. 

For me, not knowing how to proceed is the #1 reason for procrastination, and I 
want to make sure that doesn't afflict others if I can help it.

## Concluding Thoughts

There are still issues for us to work our around this practice. 

As our pace picks up, new folks are inundated with specific functional practices
(i.e. designers: learning how we organize our Sass, developers: fixing something 
that is actually currently broken) and that means we don't always do a great 
job scheduling support time. 

We make up for that as a company by making sure support has a voice at the 
table in everything, and making sure we elevate larger support themes in 
company-wide communications (i.e. our weekly stand-ups include a review on major support issues).
