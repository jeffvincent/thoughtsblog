title: "The Joys of Running Uphill"
description: Don't blindly grind, taking the easy downhill route. Run uphill, and take on the major projects.

One of my favorite runs takes me from my apartment in Somerville, down through Harvard Square, along the Charles River, and then back up through Central into Somerville. The first four miles or so are gentle downhills and flats along the river. The final three miles, however, are almost entirely uphill. The toughest stretch is an aggressive climb up School Street, and it's certainly not uncommon to find me bent over, hands on my knees, sucking wind at the top. *I love it.*

Running the hills turns a simple jog into an accomplishment. The burning in my lungs and my legs makes me feel like I've conquered something.

When I started at Wistia, we had nothing but steep climbs. When you are at early stages of building a customer base, each win is monumental, and we worked really hard to earn it. Lots of phone calls, product updates, pricing changes, business model discussions. Every day felt like a sprint to the top, and it left my head swimming.

But as you grow, lots of small tasks begin to add up. With an expanding user base, supporting them becomes a grind - payments, customer service, and inbound sales become full time occupations. A growing team creates logistical challenges like meals, seats, and budgets. Everyone now has a to-do list stacked with items we'd never dreamed of doing before. These are good problems to have, don't get me wrong, but they are problems nonetheless.

It is natural to move these problems to the top, and spend our time tackling them. Some of these, like customer interactions and bug fixing, are absolutely necessary for continued growth and success. But filling our days with these 'grinding' issues is like running nothing but flats: **we are left unprepared for dealing with the big problems.**

Instead of spending the time to implement a new technology or delving deeply into how users interact with the product, we knock off several small items, like ordering food, sending a few emails, or tweaking a layout.

Without a careful eye, the company can continue slogging along like this indefinitely. After all, each person looks and sounds busy, new people can be brought on at a fairly regular pace to take on more tasks, and customers are fairly happy. **We can easily put off making major changes, or tackling large projects, because there is simply 'too much to do'.**

Don't.

**Fight against the growth of 'grinding tasks'.** Take the programming concept of 'DRY' (don't repeat yourself) and apply it wherever possible. Automate the building of spreadsheets. Build awesome static resources for your customers to learn from. Stop quibbling over opinions - run the tests, get the data, and then discuss. You'll spend less time *just doing stuff*, and more time *doing the right stuff*.

**Buck convention, and attack grinding problems in new ways.** Experiment with new approaches, instead of slogging along doing the same things in the same way. Yes, this is harder to do, but it is so worth it. This can be described as 'working smarter, not harder'.

**Define ownership for projects, and don't allow anyone to 'own' too much.** One of the tendencies I've seen is veterans giving newer folks false ownership. Instead of really handing it over, veterans seek to hold the 'final word' and provide input every step of the way. Let the new folks run with it, and trust that you hired the right people.

**Above all, focus.** Many times, there are simply too many things going on. We take on lots of 'flat' or 'downhill' projects. In the pursuit of moving fast, each person produces four murky solutions instead of one beautiful, elegant, and simple solution. Don't confuse a minimum viable product with an uncreative or sloppy job.

One process I've adopted since we started using iDoneThis is the [Andreessen method](http://blog.idonethis.com/post/34170232603/marc-andreessens-productivity-trick-to-feeling) - writing down everything I do. At the end of the week, I look back to see what was repetitive, what took me too long to complete, and get an idea of how I can improve.

Doing these things will allow your team to tackle those big projects that make the user experience out-of-this-world. The updates that make the product work more intuitively. The business model changes that separate you from competitors. The big, behind-the-scenes improvements that enables you to scale freely.

Run uphill.
