** Don't Lose Focus on What You Love **

This is a lesson that took me years and many mistakes to learn. In sharing it, I hope to help others identify if they are currently going down this path. 

If you love to do something, do it. Don't spend time on something you don't like, or that is a weakness, just to fulfill expectations. You probably won't become an expert in something you hate doing anyway, so you might as well focus on becoming the best you can be at what you love doing.

I went to college to study computers and physics. I had an amazing physics teacher in High School and I developed a pretty good grasp on how it works. But the curriculum for Engineering students was full of basic science requirements, which I wasn't into. Having always had the goal of 'well rounded student' drilled into my head, I took time away from my physics work to slog through an understanding of general chemistry (which I still don't get). The same thing for differential equations, which I couldn't explain if I had to. The result, if you couldn't guess, is that I ended up treading water through two years of Engineering courses before I quit. It was my first time struggling in academics in my life, and I really couldn't pull myself out of it.

After I mercifully graduated college, I went to work in 'advertising'. The work mostly consisted of signing paperwork and excel spreadsheets our clients requested, only to have them change their mind. I'd never had a desk job, and assumed mindless paperwork was just part of the process. I spent nearly all my time trying to get better at mindless tasks - I just couldn't believe how badly I sucked at it. The two years I spent in advertising were nearly completely devoid of me learning new things or doing things I loved.

The lesson I've taken away from all this suffering is that letting expectations dictate what you spend your time doing is a terrible waste. In 10 years, you'll forget the general chemistry you shoved into your brain during all-nighters to get a 'B' on a quiz. You will regret the time you spent signing paperwork (especially if you hate it like I do). Spend your time doing something you love.
